# golang-snippets

After several weeks of working on the Golang Snippet project, it has become apparent that the implementation of certain rules would be beneficial. Firstly, there are a plethora of magic numbers present throughout the code, which while effective in demonstrating functionality, can impede the reusability of the project. Secondly, there is currently a lack of structure to the various Golang snippets, with the project primarily consisting of a collection of .go files. The module requirements have become increasingly cumbersome, and it would be advantageous to incorporate infrastructure context, such as scripts, Ansible, or Terraform, to better demonstrate practical usage. Lastly, for the purpose of experimentation, it is intended to also incorporate C code alongside the existing Golang snippets.
