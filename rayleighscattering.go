	/*
		The Rayleigh scattering law is a formula used to calculate the scattering of light by particles in a medium. It states that the scattering intensity is proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength of the light. In other words, shorter wavelengths (such as blue or violet) are scattered more intensely than longer wavelengths (such as red).

		The formula for the Rayleigh scattering law is:

		I = k * λ^-4

		where:

		I is the intensity of the scattered light
		k is a constant that depends on the size and composition of the particles
		λ is the wavelength of the light
		
		This is code snippet that calculates the scattering for a given wavelength.
